I can't access external links directly. However, you can provide me with the key details of the project, such as its purpose, main features, installation instructions, usage, and any other relevant information. With that, I can help you draft a README file for your repository.

I still can't access external content directly. If you could share the essential details or contents from the repository, I'd be happy to help you create or refine your README file! You can provide an overview, key features, installation steps, and usage instructions, and I'll draft a README based on that information.

This is a sample program that recognizes hand signs and finger gestures with a simple MLP using the detected key points. Handpose is estimated using MediaPipe.

Great, here's a draft for your README file based on the provided details:

Hand Sign and Gesture Recognition
This project is a sample program that recognizes hand signs and finger gestures using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The hand pose is estimated using MediaPipe, which provides key points for hand landmarks.

Overview
The system detects hand gestures by analyzing key points estimated from the hand's pose. These key points are then used as inputs to a simple MLP model for gesture classification.

Features
Hand Pose Estimation: Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and key points.
Gesture Recognition: Implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to classify different hand signs and gestures.
Real-Time Processing: Processes hand gestures in real-time for interactive applications.
Usage
Run the Program:
python main.py
Instructions:
The program will start capturing video from your webcam.
Perform hand gestures in front of the camera.
The system will recognize and display the corresponding gesture on the screen.
Requirements
Python 3.x
MediaPipe
TensorFlow (or other deep learning frameworks if used)
OpenCV (for video capture and processing)
